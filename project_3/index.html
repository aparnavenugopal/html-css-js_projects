           <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological 
              kingdom Animalia (/ˌænɪˈmeɪliə/[4]). With few exceptions, animals 
              consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are 
              able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere 
              of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form 
              a clade, meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor.</p>
            <!-- <p>Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described, of which 
                around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 
                65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million 
                animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) 
                to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with each 
                other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study 
                of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviors is known as 
                ethology.</p> -->
            <h3>My Dog</h3>
            <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/525220069/photo/beautiful-happy-reddish-havanese-puppy-dog-is-sitting-frontal.jpg?s=612x612&w=is&k=20&c=J8tOmT_8oTcmZOg5MXf0aS7Qs3Od5Ixdml13INPb9tc=" alt="doggy"/>
            <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated 
                descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated 
                from an extinct population of Pleistocene wolves over 14,000 years ago. 
                The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate 
                that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, which 
                was before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association 
                with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals 
                and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate 
                for other canids.[4]</p>
